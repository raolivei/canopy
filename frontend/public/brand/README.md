## Design Concept

The LedgerLight brand features a modern, clean circular coin icon with a bold dollar sign symbol at its center. The mint/teal gradient evokes trust, clarity, and financial insight. The design is minimalist and scales beautifully across all sizes.

## Usage notes

- The icon set covers favicons through store artwork; use `ledgerlight-icon-512.png` for desktop installers and `ledgerlight-icon-1024.png` for app marketplaces.
- The banners are laid out for hero sections; use the `*-og.png` variants when configuring social cards (OG/Twitter).
- Text in the logos uses `Inter`, `SF Pro Display`, or system sans-serif with letter-spacing for a modern, clean appearance.
- The circular coin icon represents financial clarity and the "light" in LedgerLight - illuminating your financial data.
- Maintain the mint/teal gradient for brand consistency; it's the signature element of the identity.
