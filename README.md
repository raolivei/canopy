# Canopy

**Your financial life. Under one canopy.**

Canopy is a self-hosted personal finance, investment, and budgeting dashboard inspired by Monarch Money, Ghostfolio, and Firefly III. It runs fully local on Raspberry Pi k3s clusters with a lean footprint, storing all data locally without cloud dependencies.

## Project Objectives

- Combine portfolio, budgeting, and net-worth views into a single dashboard.
- Store all data locally — no cloud dependencies.
- Support multi-currency (CAD, USD, BRL, EUR, GBP) assets.
- Allow easy CSV/OFX imports for banks and brokerages.
- Run lean — optimized for Raspberry Pi hardware.
- Be modular so other developers can fork and extend.

### Design Rationale

**Why Single Dashboard?**
Financial health requires seeing the big picture. Combining portfolio, budgeting, and transactions in one view helps users understand their complete financial situation without switching between tools.

**Why Local Storage?**

- **Privacy:** Financial data never leaves your control
- **Security:** No cloud breaches can expose your data
- **Control:** You decide when and how to back up
- **Compliance:** Meets data residency requirements

**Why Multi-Currency?**
Modern users often have assets across currencies. Proper currency support enables accurate net worth calculation and meaningful spending analysis regardless of transaction currency.

**Why CSV/OFX Import?**
Most banks don't offer APIs. CSV/OFX files are universal formats that allow users to import transaction history from any financial institution, making the tool truly platform-agnostic.

**Why Raspberry Pi Optimized?**
Democratizes self-hosting by using affordable, low-power hardware. Enables 24/7 operation without significant electricity costs while maintaining full control over data.

## Current Version

**v0.4.0** - Insights & FIRE Planning release with portfolio analytics.

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for detailed release notes.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose (recommended)
- Python 3.11+ with venv (for local development fallback)
- Node.js 18+ and npm (for local development fallback)
- k3s cluster (optional, for production deployment)

### Recommended: Docker Compose (Primary Method)

```bash
# Load port assignments from workspace-config
source ../workspace-config/ports/.env.ports

# Start all services with hot reload
docker-compose up

# Or start in detached mode
docker-compose up -d
```

**Access:**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3001
- API: http://localhost:8001
- API Docs: http://localhost:8001/docs

**Benefits:**

- Consistent environment (matches production)
- Hot reload enabled via volume mounts
- No local Python/Node version conflicts
- Single command to start everything

See `../workspace-config/docs/DOCKER_COMPOSE_GUIDE.md` for complete guide.

### Alternative: Local Development (Fallback)

#### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
PYTHONPATH=/path/to/canopy python3 -m uvicorn app.server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

**Why PYTHONPATH?**
Python needs to find the `backend` module for absolute imports (`from backend.api import ...`). Setting PYTHONPATH to project root allows imports to work regardless of current directory.

**Why `--reload`?**
Enables auto-reload on code changes during development, speeding up iteration. Remove in production for better performance.

**Why `0.0.0.0`?**
Binds to all network interfaces, allowing access from other devices on your network (e.g., testing on mobile). Use `127.0.0.1` for localhost-only access.

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Why Separate Processes?**
Backend and frontend are independent services. Separating them allows:

- Independent scaling
- Different deployment strategies
- Team members to work on one without affecting the other
- Technology choices (Python backend, Node.js frontend)

### Testing

Run the test script to verify all functionality:

```bash
./test_app.sh
```

### Access

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Insights & FIRE Planning

The Insights page (`/insights`) provides comprehensive financial analytics:

### Net Worth Dashboard

- Total net worth with multi-currency support
- Assets vs liabilities breakdown
- Currency exposure analysis

- **Progress**: Visual progress bar showing % complete
- **Projections**: 30-year net worth projections

Default assumptions (customizable):

- Monthly expenses: $5,000 CAD (~$3,600 USD)
- Safe Withdrawal Rate: 4%
- Expected Return: 7%

### What-If Scenarios

Compare different scenarios:

- Save $500 more per month
- Save $1000 more per month
- Reduce expenses by 10%
- 8% vs 7% vs 5% annual returns

## Database Seeding

To populate the database with sample data:

```bash
cd backend

# Seed the database
python -m backend.scripts.seed_portfolio

# Clear and reseed
python -m backend.scripts.seed_portfolio --clear
```

The seed script includes:

- 40+ accounts across Canada, USA, and Brazil
- Historical snapshots from Sep 2024 to present
- Real estate (apartment with 50% ownership)
- Liabilities (credit cards, car loan)
- Crypto holdings (by platform and aggregated by coin)
